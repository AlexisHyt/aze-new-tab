# Aze New Tab

## Overview

This project is a Chrome extension designed to modify your new tab to fit your needs.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

I highly recommend you to uninstall the extension and install it again. Exporting and importing presets might not work properly because of some changes in the storage.

## Features

- Export and Import presets and share them with your friends

Inside the popup, you can customize:
